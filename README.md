The website I am working on is the second project for our school this year.

It focuses on images such as PNG, SVG, and Bézier curves.

In this project, we learned about Bézier curves, their functionalities, and how to use them.

My website showcases examples of these images, along with a short description for each.

The theme of my project is the Twitter logo. As you can guess, I have created Twitter-themed images and included them on the website.

I used the original Twitter color in the page design, but I also added an option to change the color to your preferred one.

To make things more interesting, I created a drawing animation for the Bézier curve, where users can control the animation speed.

These pictures are free to download, so you can use them for your own projects.

The website contains four pages: a home page and one page for each picture.
